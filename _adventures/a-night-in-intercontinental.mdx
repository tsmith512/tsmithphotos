  Thanks to Oklahoma weather, I was offered the opportunity to sleep on the
  floor in Houston.
intro: >
  Generally teeming with travelers from all over the world, this is one of the
  busiest places I find myself on a regular basis. But I was surprised: even
  this airport slows down late at night. Without the passengers, IAH becomes an
  abandoned but clean, luminous expanse of curious architecture, repetitive
  furniture, and hauntingly wide spaces.

<Story filename="Adventures - IAH/DSC_9148.jpg" copy="right">

  I walked about twelve miles between 9pm and 3am. As got tired, I
  happened upon a group of other stranded travelers in the B South
  Concourse. I joined in the card games and we talked about our
  adventures. Two sisters from Mexico traveling home from a mission
  trip in Tel Aviv, a newlywed Canadian couple headed to South America,
  and a violin-playing Californian exchange student en route from France.

  Then we watched the sunrise together, and flew off in different directions.
