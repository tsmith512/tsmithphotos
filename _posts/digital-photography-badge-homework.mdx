  I was invited to be the special guest to talk to a local Girl Scout troop
  about photography.

  <Subhead>Take Tons of photographs.</Subhead>

    I suppose Step One was our conversation about light, perspective, getting
    different views of the subject, and thinking of fun things to take pictures
    of in nature. Then step two: photographing the photographers as we went
    on a nature walk to practice.

    Here are my seven photos from the Pfirefly Service Unit Nature Photo Hunt,
    which I did at my uncle's family ranch the week after our meet.

  <strong>Perspective fun:</strong> Find an object in the distance. Ellie (the
  dog) being so far away, but also being the subject of the photo, makes the
  river feel really big.

  <strong>Color challenge:</strong> How many colors of the rainbow can you find
  in something? These blue bonnets are getting toward the end of their season,
  so some of the bright greens and blues have faded a little, and pink is
  showing through, too.

  <strong>Bird challenge:</strong> Take a picture of a bird in flight! Took a
  few tries to get one I liked.

  <strong>Bug/Butterfly Challenge:</strong> I know a snake isn't a bug, but he
  was only the size of a pencil and he let me take his photo!
</Story>

  <strong>Black and white Ansel Adams challenge:</strong> Ansel Adams was known
  for photos of huge, dramatic landscapes with super bright highlights and very
  dark contrasts. This might not quite be his style, but I tried to bring out
  texture and "values" (light vs. dark) in the light fog and the river water.

  <strong>Water drop:</strong> This counts, right? ;-) I took at least a hundred
  photos of Ellie doing this until I got one I liked. Usually the water didn't
  look right or she was making crazy faces.

  <strong>Hometown love:</strong> This isn't my home, but I grew up going here
  with my family a
  few times each year. This is the horse pen and barn at the ranch. Recent spring
  rains are turning the grasses green again and making a lot of deep clouds.
